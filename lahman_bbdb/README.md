# 2016 Lahman Baseball Database for PostgreSQL

## Background

This repo stores the PostgreSQL schema for the 2016 Version of Lahman's Baseball Database, originally published for MySQL.

I have uploaded the CSV files as a courtesy here because the GIDP column in the PitchingPost table is set up to be an integer, but the raw CSV data hosted on Sean Lahman's website tabulated some GIDP values as floats (e.g. 0.0, 1.0, 2.0). Also fixed were some data irregularities noted [here](https://github.com/chadwickbureau/baseballdatabank/issues/60) and [here](https://github.com/chadwickbureau/baseballdatabank/issues/58), but not all of them--the majority are in the Master.csv file (please see below Importing section for more details), related to last names like "O'\*", and remain unfixed (for now).

## Importing

1. Download the files in this repo
2. Create a database in PostgreSQL
3. Import the schema file into the database via the command line ($ psql [database_name] < lahman_2016_schema.sql)
4. Update the lahman_2016_import.csv file to include the filepath of the .csv files in the csv folder.
5. Import the CSV files into the database via the command line ($ psql [database_name] < lahman_2016_import.sql)

You can find the source of the CSV files hosted on [Sean Lahman's website](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics). There are also ongoing updates to the files made by Ted Turocy on Github [here](https://github.com/chadwickbureau/baseballdatabank).

As mentioned in the background, there is some erroneous data owing to an issue with the script used to generate the data. I will be keeping an eye on the repo and updating the data as fixes come in.

## add_id.py

add_id.py Python script that will add a column "id" with numbers incrementing 1 through n total rows in the included CSV files. This script is helpful if you need to modify the schema in this repo to read like so:

```SQL

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS AllStarFull;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS AllStarFull (
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	...
	UNIQUE (playerID,yearID,gameNum)
);

```

Rather than in its current form:

```SQL

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS AllStarFull;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS AllStarFull (
	...
	PRIMARY KEY (playerID,yearID,gameNum)
);

```

Instructions for the script are included in comments in the file.
